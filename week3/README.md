# Week #3 Coding Exercises

Problems are grouped by applicable problem solving strategy here. Within each group problems appear in roughly increasing order of difficulty. If you get stuck on a problem in one group, you can switch to a problem in another group and go back later. This can help make sure you keep making progress.


### Greedy algorithms

* https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change

* https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies

* https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence

* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons

* https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels

### Binary search

* https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search

* https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array

### Sorting

* https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram

* https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i

* https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals

* Use sorting, not a multiset (you solved this problem using a multiset last week) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string

### Recursion and memoization: make sure you use memoization if applicable for the problems below

* https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n

* https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

* https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance

* https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii

Do not use a built-in regex for this one: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/

### Dynamic Programming: same problems as above, but use dynamic programming this time

* https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

* https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance

* https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii

* Do not use a built-in regex for this one: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/
